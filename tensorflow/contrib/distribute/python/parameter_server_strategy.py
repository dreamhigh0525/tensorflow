class ParameterServerStrategy(distribute_lib.DistributionStrategy):
  """A parameter server DistributionStrategy.

  This strategy class works for both local training and between-graph replicated
  training for multiple workers. If `cluster_spec` is specified, either passed
  in to __init__() method or parsed from the
  ["TF_CONFIG" environment
  variable](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/RunConfig),
  variables and updates to those variables are assigned to parameter servers and
  other operations are assigned to workers. If `cluster_spec` is not set, it
  becomes local training where variables are assigned to local CPU or the only
  GPU. When each worker has more than one GPU, operations will be replicated on
  these GPUs. In both cases, operations are replicated but variables are not and
  these workers share a common view for which paramater server a variable is
  assigned to.

  This class assumes between-graph replication will be used and works on a graph
  for a particular worker. Note that each graph and worker is independent.
  This means that while each worker will synchronously compute a single gradient
  update across all GPUs, updates between workers proceed asynchronously.
  Operations that occur only on the first tower (such as incrementing the global
  step), will occur on the first tower *of every worker*.

  It is expected to call `call_for_each_tower(fn, *args, **kwargs)` for any
  operations which potentially can be replicated across towers (i.e. multiple
  GPUs) even if there is only CPU or one GPU. When defining the `fn`, extra
  caution needs to be taken:

  1) Always use `tf.get_variable` instead of `tf.Variable` which is not able
  to refer to the same variable on different towers.

  2) It is generally not recommended to open a device scope under the strategy's
  scope. A device scope (i.e. calling `tf.device`) will be merged with or
  override the device for operations but will not change the device for
  variables.

  3) It is also not recommended to open a colocation scope (i.e. calling
  `tf.colocate_with`) under the strategy's scope. For colocating variables,
  use `distribution.colocate_vars_with` instead. Colocation of ops will possibly
  create conflicts of device assignment.
