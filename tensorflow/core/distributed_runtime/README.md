# Distributed TensorFlow

This directory contains the initial open-source implementation of the
distributed TensorFlow runtime, using [gRPC](http://grpc.io) for inter-process
communication.

To learn how to use the distributed runtime to create a TensorFlow cluster,
see the "Distributed TensorFlow" How To, which is available both [in this
repository](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/g3doc/how_tos/distributed/index.md) and [on the TensorFlow website]
(https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/distributed/index.html).
