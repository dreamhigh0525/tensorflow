# Changes since last release

## Breaking changes to the API

* `AdjustContrast` kernel deprecated, new kernel `AdjustContrastv2` takes and
  outputs float only. `adjust_contrast` now takes all data types.
* `adjust_brightness`'s `delta` argument is now always assumed to be in `[0,1]`
  (as is the norm for images in floating point formats), independent of the
  data type of the input image.
* The image processing ops do not take `min` and `max` inputs any more, casting
  safety is handled by `saturate_cast`, which makes sure over- and underflows
  are handled before casting to data types with smaller ranges.

# Release 0.6.0

## Major Features and Improvements

* Python 3.3+ support via changes to python codebase and ability
  to specify python version via ./configure.

* Some improvements to GPU performance and memory usage:
  [convnet benchmarks](https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks/issues/66)
  roughly equivalent with native cudnn v2 performance.  Improvements mostly due
  to moving to 32-bit indices, faster shuffling kernels.  More improvements to
  come in later releases.


## Bug fixes

* Lots of fixes to documentation and tutorials, many contributed
  by the public.

* 271 closed issues on github issues.

## Backwards-incompatible changes

* tf.nn.fixed_unigram_candidate_sampler changed its default 'distortion'
  attribute from 0.0 to 1.0. This was a bug in the original release
  that is now fixed.

# Release 0.5.0

Initial release of TensorFlow.
