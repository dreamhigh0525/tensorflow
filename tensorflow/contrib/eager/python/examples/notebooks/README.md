## Research and experimentation

Eager execution provides an imperative, define-by-run interface for advanced
operations. Write custom layers, forward passes, and training loops with auto
differentiation. Start with these notebooks, then read the
[eager execution guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager).
