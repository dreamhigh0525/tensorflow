    Args:
      initial_value: A `Tensor`, or Python object convertible to a `Tensor`,
        which is the initial value for the Variable. The initial value must have
        a shape specified unless `validate_shape` is set to False. Can also be a
        callable with no argument that returns the initial value when called.
        (Note that initializer functions from init_ops.py must first be bound
         to a shape before being used here.)
      trainable: If `True`, GradientTapes automatically watch uses of this
        Variable.
      caching_device: Optional device string or function describing where the
        Variable should be cached for reading.  Defaults to the Variable's
        device.  If not `None`, caches on another device.  Typical use is to
        cache on the device where the Ops using the Variable reside, to
        deduplicate copying through `Switch` and other conditional statements.
      name: Optional name for the variable. Defaults to `'Variable'` and gets
        uniquified automatically.
      dtype: If set, initial_value will be converted to the given type.
        If None, either the datatype will be kept (if initial_value is
       a Tensor) or float32 will be used (if it is a Python object convertible
       to a Tensor).
      constraint: An optional projection function to be applied to the variable
        after being updated by an `Optimizer` (e.g. used to implement norm
        constraints or value constraints for layer weights). The function must
        take as input the unprojected Tensor representing the value of the
        variable and return the Tensor for the projected value
        (which must have the same shape). Constraints are not safe to
        use when doing asynchronous distributed training.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If the initial value is not specified, or does not have a
        shape and `validate_shape` is `True`.
