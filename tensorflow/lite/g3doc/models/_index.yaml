    - heading: Optimized for edge
      description: >
        Edge has many constraints, such as limited memory, speed, and power. These models are specifically designed to run on-device.
    - heading: Built by TensorFlow
      description: >
        These models were optimized by the talented TensorFlow Lite team. Breathe easy.
    - heading: Customizable
      description: >
        The models were trained with certain labels in mind. With transfer learning, you can customize them to fit your needs.

    - heading: Benefits of pre-trained models
      description: >
        The best way to get started is to used pre-trained models because they
        allow you to save time and money, leverage learnings from research scientists,
        and avoid expensive datasets. Instead of having to start from scratch, you
        could use an existing model and just retrain the last few layers of the
        neural network to suit your needs. This process is called transfer learning.
