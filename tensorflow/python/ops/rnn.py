  """Creates a recurrent neural network specified by RNNCell "cell".

  The simplest form of RNN network generated is:
    state = cell.zero_state(...)
    outputs = []
    for input_ in inputs:
      output, state = cell(input_, state)
      outputs.append(output)
    return (outputs, state)

  However, a few other options are available:

  An initial state can be provided.
  If sequence_length is provided, dynamic calculation is performed.

  Dynamic calculation returns, at time t:
    (t >= max(sequence_length)
        ? (zeros(output_shape), zeros(state_shape))
        : cell(input, state)

  Thus saving computational time when unrolling past the max sequence length.

  Args:
    cell: An instance of RNNCell.
    inputs: A length T list of inputs, each a tensor of shape
      [batch_size, cell.input_size].
    initial_state: (optional) An initial state for the RNN.  This must be
      a tensor of appropriate type and shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state.  Required if
      initial_state is not provided.
    sequence_length: An int64 vector (tensor) size [batch_size].
    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "RNN".

  Returns:
    A pair (outputs, state) where:
      outputs is a length T list of outputs (one for each input)
      state is the final state
