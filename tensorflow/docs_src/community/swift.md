# Swift Community

Welcome to the Swift for TensorFlow development community!

Swift for TensorFlow is the result of first-principles thinking applied to
machine learning frameworks and aims to take TensorFlow usability to new
heights. Swift for TensorFlow is based on the belief that machine learning is
important enough for first-class language and compiler support, and thus works
very differently from normal language bindings.

First-class language and compiler support allow us to innovate in areas that
traditionally were out of bounds for machine learning libraries. Our programming
model combines the performance of TensorFlow graphs with the flexibility and
expressivity of Eager execution, while keeping a strong focus on improved
usability at every level of the stack.


## Open Source

We have released Swift for TensorFlow as an open-source project on GitHub!

Our [central repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) contains project
documentation, including an 
[overview and technical papers](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/tree/master/docs)
explaining specific areas of the project in depth. This repo also includes
instructions for [installing prebuilt packages](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md)
for macOS and Linux platforms, [simple usage instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Usage.md),
and how to build from source.

Moving forward, we will use an open design model and all discussions will be
public.

group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/swift), which we will
use for announcements and general discussion.
