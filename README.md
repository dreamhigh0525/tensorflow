TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs.  Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them.  This flexible architecture lets you deploy computation to one
or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting
code.  TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers
working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence research
organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural
networks research.  The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide
variety of other domains, as well.

# Download and Setup

To install the CPU version of TensorFlow using a binary package, see the
instructions below.  For more detailed installation instructions, including
installing from source, GPU-enabled support, etc., see
[here](tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md).

## Binary Installation

The TensorFlow Python API supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+.

The simplest way to install TensorFlow is using
[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) for both Linux and Mac.

For the GPU-enabled version, or if you encounter installation errors, or for
more detailed installation instructions, see
[here](tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md#detailed_install).

### Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit

```bash
# For CPU-only version
$ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Mac OS X

```bash
# Only CPU-version is available at the moment.
$ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl
```

### Try your first TensorFlow program

```sh
$ python

>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> sess.run(hello)
Hello, TensorFlow!
>>> a = tf.constant(10)
>>> b = tf.constant(32)
>>> sess.run(a+b)
42
>>>

```
