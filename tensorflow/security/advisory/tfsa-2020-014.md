## TFSA-2020-014: Integer truncation in Shard API usage

### CVE Number
CVE-2020-15202

### Impact
The `Shard` API in TensorFlow expects the last argument to be a function taking
two `int64` (i.e., `long long`) arguments:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/util/work_sharder.h#L59-L60

However, there are several places in TensorFlow where a lambda taking `int` or
`int32` arguments is being used:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/random_op.cc#L204-L205
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/random_op.cc#L317-L318

In these cases, if the amount of work to be parallelized is large enough,
integer truncation occurs. Depending on how the two arguments of the lambda are
used, this can result in segfaults, read/write outside of heap allocated arrays,
stack overflows, or data corruption.
