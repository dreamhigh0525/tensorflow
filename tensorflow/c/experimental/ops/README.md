# Experimental C++ Ops

The C++ files in this directory (***\*_ops.h*** and ***\*_ops.cc***) are
autogenerated during build time from the registered Op and API definitions.

To generate additional operators, extend the lists in the ***BUILD*** file. Note
that category names correspond to generated source file names, and so they
should be consistent with the original source files registering each operator.

For example, since `REGISTER_OP("MatMul")` appears in ***core/math_ops.cc***,
the "MatMul" operator in the script should be in the "math" category. In this
case, the "MatMul" op would be available for use by including the file
***c/experimental/ops/math_ops.h*** and adding the matching math_ops library
dependency.

The generated source code typically remains available for viewing in the build
directory. In addition, a test for each category will contain the generated
source. For example, the output log from the `:gen_math_ops_test` test shows the
contents of ***math_ops.h*** and ***math_ops.cc***.
