# TensorFlow for .NET / C#

**TensorFlow.NET** (TF.NET) provides a .NET Standard binding for [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). It aims to implement the complete TensorFlow API in CSharp which allows .NET developers to develop, train and deploy Machine Learning models with the cross-platform .NET Standard framework.

> *WARNING*: The TensorFlow .NET API is not currently covered by the TensorFlow
> [API stability guarantees](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/version_compat).

## Quickstart

-   Refer to [Installing TensorFlow for .NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET)
-   [TensorFlow.NET doc](https://tensorflownet.readthedocs.io/)
-   [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/TensorFlow.NET.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TensorFlow.NET)

More practical examples refer to [TensorFlow.NET Examples](https://github.com/SciSharp/SciSharp-Stack-Examples).



**TensorFlow.NET Eager Mode is working in progress on master branch.**
