"""## Input pipeline

TensorFlow functions for setting up an input-prefetching pipeline.
Please see the [reading data how-to](../../how_tos/reading_data.md)
for context.

### Beginning of an input pipeline

The "producer" functions add a queue to the graph and a corresponding
QueueRunner for running the subgraph that fills that queue.

@@match_filenames_once
@@limit_epochs
@@range_input_producer
@@slice_input_producer
@@string_input_producer

### Batching at the end of an input pipeline

These functions add a queue to the graph to assemble a batch of
examples, with possible shuffling.  They also add a QueueRunner for
running the subgraph that fills that queue.

Use [batch](#batch) or [batch_join](#batch_join) for batching examples that have
already been well shuffled.  Use [shuffle_batch](#shuffle_batch) or
[shuffle_batch_join](#shuffle_batch_join) for examples that
would benefit from additional shuffling.

Use [batch](#batch) or [shuffle_batch](#shuffle_batch) if you want a
single thread producing examples to batch, or if you have a
single subgraph producing examples but you want to run it in N threads
(where you increase N until it can keep the queue full).  Use
[batch_join](#batch_join) or [shuffle_batch_join](#shuffle_batch_join)
if you have N different subgraphs producing examples to batch and you
want them run by N threads.
