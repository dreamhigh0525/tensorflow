TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs.  Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them.  This flexible architecture lets you deploy computation to one
or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting
code.  TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers
working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence research
organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural
networks research.  The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide
variety of other domains, as well.

# Download and Setup

See [install instructions](tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md).

### Try your first TensorFlow program

```sh
$ python

>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> sess.run(hello)
Hello, TensorFlow!
>>> a = tf.constant(10)
>>> b = tf.constant(32)
>>> sess.run(a+b)
42
>>>

```
