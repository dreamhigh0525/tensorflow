# K-FAC: Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature

**K-FAC in TensorFlow** is an implementation of [K-FAC][kfac-paper], an
approximate second-order optimization method, in TensorFlow. When applied to
feedforward and convolutional neural networks, K-FAC can converge `>3.5x`
faster in `>14x` fewer iterations than SGD with Momentum.
