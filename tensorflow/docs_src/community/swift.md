# Swift Community

Welcome to the Swift for TensorFlow development community!

Swift for TensorFlow is the result of first-principles thinking applied to
machine learning frameworks and aims to take TensorFlow usability to new
heights. Swift for TensorFlow is based on the belief that machine learning is
important enough for first-class language and compiler support, and thus works
very differently from normal language bindings.

First-class language and compiler support allow us to innovate in areas that
traditionally were out of bounds for machine learning libraries. Our
programming model combines the performance of TensorFlow graphs with the
flexibility and expressivity of Eager execution, while keeping a strong focus
on improved usability at every level of the stack.

## Open Source

We have released Swift for TensorFlow as an open-source project on GitHub!

Our [documentation repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) contains a
[project overview](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/DesignOverview.md)
and [technical papers](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/tree/master/docs)
explaining specific areas in depth. There are also instructions for [installing
pre-built packages](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md)
(for macOS and Ubuntu) as well as a simple
[usage tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Usage.md).

Moving forward, we will use an open design model and all discussions will be
public.

[Sign up here to join the community Google
group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/swift), which we will
use for announcements and general discussion.
