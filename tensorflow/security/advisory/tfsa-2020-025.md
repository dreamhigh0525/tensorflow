## TFSA-2020-025: Undefined behavior in `dlpack.to_dlpack`

### CVE Number
CVE-2020-15191

### Impact
If a user passes an invalid argument to `dlpack.to_dlpack` the expected
validations will cause variables to bind to `nullptr` while setting a `status`
variable to the error condition.

However, this `status` argument is not properly checked:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/c/eager/dlpack.cc#L265-L267

Hence, code following these methods will bind references to null pointers:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/c/eager/dlpack.cc#L279-L285

This is undefined behavior and reported as an error if compiling with
`-fsanitize=null`.

### Vulnerable Versions
TensorFlow 2.2.0, 2.3.0.
