  Loss scaling is a process that:

  1) Applies a multiplier on the loss before computing gradients, and
  2) Applies the reciprocal of the multiplier on the gradients before they are
     applied on variables.

  Mathematically, loss scaling has no effect, but can help avoid numerical
  underflow when float16 tensors are used. By multiplying the loss, each
  gradient will have the same multiplier applied.

  Instances of this class compute the loss scale. Method `get_loss_scale()`
  returns the current loss scale, while method `update()` updates the loss scale
  depending on the values of the gradients. Optimizers use instances of this
  class to scale loss and gradients.

    This function also returns a `should_apply_gradients` bool. If False,
