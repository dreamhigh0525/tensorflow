Reads up to &quot;n&quot; bytes from the file starting at &quot;offset&quot;.

&quot;scratch[0..n-1]&quot; may be written by this routine. Sets &quot;*result&quot; to the data that was read (including if fewer than &quot;n&quot; bytes were successfully read). May set &quot;*result&quot; to point at data in &quot;scratch[0..n-1]&quot;, so &quot;scratch[0..n-1]&quot; must be live when &quot;*result&quot; is used.

On OK returned status: &quot;n&quot; bytes have been stored in &quot;*result&quot;. On non-OK returned status: [0..n] bytes have been stored in &quot;*result&quot;.

Returns OUT_OF_RANGE if fewer than n bytes were stored in &quot;*result&quot; because of EOF.

Safe for concurrent use by multiple threads.
