// Temporary memories are used to allocate scratch space required by an
// operation about to be enqueued onto a stream.
//
//    std::unique_ptr<TemporaryDeviceMemory<float>> temporary_memory =
//        stream.AllocateTemporaryArray<float>(1024).value();
//    // ... enqueue stuff onto the stream using the temporary memory ...
//    // Note that the memory is accessible via
//    // temporary_memory->device_memory() and similar.
//
//    // Finalize the temporary memory. The underlying device memory may
//    // be released any time after this program point, as another thread may
//    // call Stream::BlockHostUntilDone, causing synchronization. This
//    // finalization also happens automatically for the user if the unique_ptr
//    // goes out of scope.
//    temporary_memory.Finalize();
//
// WARNING: do NOT hold onto the device memory associated with temporary_memory
// after finalization. If temporary_memory->device_memory() is used after the
// temporary memory is finalized, it will cause a DCHECK failure.
//
// Note that standard usage takes advantage of the type-safe wrapper,
// TemporaryDeviceMemory<T>, defined below.
//
// Also see tests for executable sample usage.
