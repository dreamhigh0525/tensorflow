class OptimizerV2(optimizer_v1.Optimizer):
  """Updated base class for optimizers.

  This class defines the API to add Ops to train a model.  You never use this
  class directly, but instead instantiate one of its subclasses such as
  `GradientDescentOptimizer`, `AdagradOptimizer`, or `MomentumOptimizer`.

  ### Usage

  ```python
  # Create an optimizer with the desired parameters.
  opt = GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)
  # Add Ops to the graph to minimize a cost by updating a list of variables.
  # "cost" is a Tensor, and the list of variables contains tf.Variable
  # objects.
  opt_op = opt.minimize(cost, var_list=<list of variables>)
  ```

  In the training program you will just have to run the returned Op.

  ```python
  # Execute opt_op to do one step of training:
  opt_op.run()
  ```

  ### Processing gradients before applying them.

  Calling `minimize()` takes care of both computing the gradients and
  applying them to the variables.  If you want to process the gradients
  before applying them you can instead use the optimizer in three steps:

  1.  Compute the gradients with `compute_gradients()`.
  2.  Process the gradients as you wish.
  3.  Apply the processed gradients with `apply_gradients()`.

  Example:

  ```python
  # Create an optimizer.
  opt = GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)

  # Compute the gradients for a list of variables.
  grads_and_vars = opt.compute_gradients(loss, <list of variables>)

  # grads_and_vars is a list of tuples (gradient, variable).  Do whatever you
  # need to the 'gradient' part, for example cap them, etc.
  capped_grads_and_vars = [(MyCapper(gv[0]), gv[1]) for gv in grads_and_vars]

  # Ask the optimizer to apply the capped gradients.
  opt.apply_gradients(capped_grads_and_vars)
  ```

  ### Gating Gradients

  Both `minimize()` and `compute_gradients()` accept a `gate_gradients`
  argument that controls the degree of parallelism during the application of
  the gradients.

  The possible values are: `GATE_NONE`, `GATE_OP`, and `GATE_GRAPH`.

  <b>`GATE_NONE`</b>: Compute and apply gradients in parallel.  This provides
  the maximum parallelism in execution, at the cost of some non-reproducibility
  in the results.  For example the two gradients of `matmul` depend on the input
  values: With `GATE_NONE` one of the gradients could be applied to one of the
  inputs _before_ the other gradient is computed resulting in non-reproducible
  results.

  <b>`GATE_OP`</b>: For each Op, make sure all gradients are computed before
  they are used.  This prevents race conditions for Ops that generate gradients
  for multiple inputs where the gradients depend on the inputs.

  <b>`GATE_GRAPH`</b>: Make sure all gradients for all variables are computed
  before any one of them is used.  This provides the least parallelism but can
  be useful if you want to process all gradients before applying any of them.

  ### Slots

  Some optimizer subclasses, such as `MomentumOptimizer` and `AdagradOptimizer`
  allocate and manage additional variables associated with the variables to
  train.  These are called <i>Slots</i>.  Slots have names and you can ask the
  optimizer for the names of the slots that it uses.  Once you have a slot name
  you can ask the optimizer for the variable it created to hold the slot value.

  This can be useful if you want to log debug a training algorithm, report stats
  about the slots, etc.

  ### Non-slot variables

  Some optimizer subclasses, such as `AdamOptimizer` have variables that
  are not associated with the variables to train, just the step itself.

  ### Hyper parameters

  These are arguments passed to the optimizer subclass constructor
  (the `__init__` method), and then passed to `self._set_hyper()`.
  They can be either regular Python values (like 1.0), tensors, or
  callables. If they are callable, the callable will be called during
  `apply_gradients()` to get the value for the hyper parameter.

  ### State

  Internal methods are passed a `state` argument with the correct
  values to use for the slot and non-slot variables, and the hyper
  parameters.

    you should be able to use the _set_hyper()/state.get_hyper()
