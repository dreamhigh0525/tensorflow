# TensorFlow Serving

TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine
learning models, designed for production environments. TensorFlow Serving
makes it easy to deploy new algorithms and experiments, while keeping the same
server architecture and APIs. TensorFlow Serving provides out-of-the-box
integration with TensorFlow models, but can be easily extended to serve other
types of models and data.

See the [basic tutorial](https://tensorflow.github.io/serving/serving_basic)
on the TensorFlow Serving site to get started.
