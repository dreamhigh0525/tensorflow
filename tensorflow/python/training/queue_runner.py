class QueueRunner(object):
  """Holds a list of enqueue operations for a queue, each to be run in a thread.

  Queues are a convenient TensorFlow mechanism to compute tensors
  asynchronously using multiple threads. For example in the canonical 'Input
  Reader' setup one set of threads generates filenames in a queue; a second set
  of threads read records from the files, processes them, and enqueues tensors
  on a second queue; a third set of threads dequeues these input records to
  construct batches and runs them through training operations.

  There are several delicate issues when running multiple threads that way:
  closing the queues in sequence as the input is exhausted, correctly catching
  and reporting exceptions, etc.

  The `QueueRunner`, combined with the `Coordinator`, helps handle these issues.

    On construction the `QueueRunner` adds an op to close the queue.  That op

    When you later call the `create_threads()` method, the `QueueRunner` will
    create one thread for each op in `enqueue_ops`.  Each thread will run its
    enqueue op in parallel with the other threads.  The enqueue ops do not have
    to all be the same op, but it is expected that they all enqueue tensors in
