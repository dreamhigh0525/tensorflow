As a Custom operator, detection_postprocess is using Flexbuffers library.
In the unit test there is a need to use flexbuffers::Builder since the operator itself use flexbuffers::Map.
However flexbuffers::Builder can not be used for most targets (basically only on X86), since it is using std::vector and std::map.
Therefore the flexbuffers::Builder data is pregenerated on X86.

To generate new data:
g++ -I../../../micro/tools/make/downloads/flatbuffers/include generate_flexbuffers_data.cc && ./a.out > flexbuffers_generated_data.h
