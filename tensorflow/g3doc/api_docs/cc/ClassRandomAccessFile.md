Reads up to "n" bytes from the file starting at "offset".

"scratch[0..n-1]" may be written by this routine. Sets "*result" to the data that was read (including if fewer than "n" bytes were successfully read). May set "*result" to point at data in "scratch[0..n-1]", so "scratch[0..n-1]" must be live when "*result" is used.

On OK returned status: "n" bytes have been stored in "*result". On non-OK returned status: [0..n] bytes have been stored in "*result".

Returns `OUT_OF_RANGE` if fewer than n bytes were stored in "*result" because of EOF.

Safe for concurrent use by multiple threads.
