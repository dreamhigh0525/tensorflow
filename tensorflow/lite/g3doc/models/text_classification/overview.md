# Text Classification

Use a pre-trained model to category a paragraph into predefined groups.

If you are new to TensorFlow Lite and are working with Android, we recommend
exploring the following example applications that can help you get started.

If you are using a platform other than Android, or you are already familiar with
the TensorFlow Lite APIs, you can download our starter text classification
model.

## How it works

Text classification categorizes a paragraph into predefined groups based on its
content.

This pretrained model predicts if a paragraph's sentiment is positive or
negative. It was trained on
[Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
from Mass et al, which consists of IMDB movie reviews labeled as either positive
or negative.

Here are the steps to classify a paragraph with the model:

1.  Tokenize the paragraph and convert it to a list of word ids using a
    predefined vocabulary.
1.  Feed the list to the TensorFlow Lite model.
1.  Get the probability of the paragraph being positive or negative from the
    model outputs.

### Note

*   Only English is supported.
*   This model was trained on movie reviews dataset so you may experience
    reduced accuracy when classifying text of other domains.

## Example output

| Text                                       | Negative (0) | Positive (1) |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| This is the best movie Iâ€™ve seen in recent | 25.3%        | 74.7%        |
: years. Strongly recommend it!              :              :              :
| What a waste of my time.                   | 72.5%        | 27.5%        |

## Use your training dataset

Follow this
[tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/tensorflow_examples/lite/model_customization/demo/text_classification.ipynb)
to apply the same technique used here to train a text classification model using
your own datasets. With the right dataset, you can create a model for use cases
such as document categorization or toxic comments detection.
