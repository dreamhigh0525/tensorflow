# Download and Setup <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-download-and-setup"></a>

You can install TensorFlow using our provided binary packages or from source.

## Binary Installation <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-binary-installation"></a>

The TensorFlow Python API requires Python 2.7.

The simplest way to install TensorFlow is using
[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) for both Linux and Mac.

If you encounter installation errors, see
[common problems](#common_install_problems) for some solutions. To simplify
installation, please consider using our virtualenv-based instructions
[here](#virtualenv_install).

### Ubuntu/Linux <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-ubuntu-linux"></a>

```bash
# For CPU-only version
$ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

# For GPU-enabled version (only install this version if you have the CUDA sdk installed)
$ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Mac OS X <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-mac-os-x"></a>

```bash
# Only CPU-version is available at the moment.
$ pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-none-any.whl
```

## Docker-based installation <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-docker-based-installation"></a>

We also support running TensorFlow via [Docker](http://docker.com/), which lets
you avoid worrying about setting up dependencies.

First, [install Docker](http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). Once
Docker is up and running, you can start a container with one command:

```bash
$ docker run -it b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
```

This will start a container with TensorFlow and all its dependencies already
installed.

### Additional images <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-additional-images"></a>

The default Docker image above contains just a minimal set of libraries for
getting up and running with TensorFlow. We also have several other containers,
which you can use in the `docker run` command above:

* `b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow-full`: Contains a complete TensorFlow source
  installation, including all utilities needed to build and run TensorFlow. This
  makes it easy to experiment directly with the source, without needing to
  install any of the dependencies described above.

## Try your first TensorFlow program <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-try-your-first-tensorflow-program"></a>

### (Optional) Enable GPU Support <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED--optional--enable-gpu-support"></a>

If you installed the GPU-enabled TensorFlow pip binary, you must have the
correct versions of the CUDA SDK and CUDNN installed on your
system.  Please see [the CUDA installation instructions](#install_cuda).

You also need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `CUDA_HOME` environment
variables.  Consider adding the commands below to your `~/.bash_profile`.  These
assume your CUDA installation is in `/usr/local/cuda`:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64"
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
```

### Run TensorFlow <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-run-tensorflow"></a>

Open a python terminal:

```bash
$ python

>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> print sess.run(hello)
Hello, TensorFlow!
>>> a = tf.constant(10)
>>> b = tf.constant(32)
>>> print sess.run(a+b)
42
>>>

```

## Installing from sources <a class="md-anchor" id="source"></a>

### Clone the TensorFlow repository <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-clone-the-tensorflow-repository"></a>

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
```

`--recurse-submodules` is required to fetch the protobuf library that TensorFlow
depends on.

### Installation for Linux <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-installation-for-linux"></a>

#### Install Bazel <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-install-bazel"></a>


Follow instructions [here](http://bazel.io/docs/install.html) to install the
dependencies for Bazel. Then download and build the Bazel source with the
following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel.git
$ cd bazel
$ git checkout tags/0.1.0
$ ./compile.sh
```

These commands use the commit tag `0.1.0`, which is known to work with
TensorFlow. `HEAD` may be unstable.

Add the executable `output/bazel` to your `$PATH` environment variable.

#### Install other dependencies <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-install-other-dependencies"></a>

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy swig python-dev
```

#### Optional: Install CUDA (GPUs on Linux) <a class="md-anchor" id="install_cuda"></a>

In order to build or run TensorFlow with GPU support, both Cuda Toolkit 7.0 and
CUDNN 6.5 V2 from NVIDIA need to be installed.

TensorFlow GPU support requires having a GPU card with NVidia Compute Capability >= 3.5.  Supported cards include but are not limited to:

* NVidia Titan
* NVidia Titan X
* NVidia K20
* NVidia K40

##### Download and install Cuda Toolkit 7.0 <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-download-and-install-cuda-toolkit-7.0"></a>

https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-70

Install the toolkit into e.g. `/usr/local/cuda`

##### Download and install CUDNN Toolkit 6.5 <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-download-and-install-cudnn-toolkit-6.5"></a>

https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive

Uncompress and copy the cudnn files into the toolkit directory.  Assuming the
toolkit is installed in `/usr/local/cuda`:

``` bash
tar xvzf cudnn-6.5-linux-x64-v2.tgz
sudo cp cudnn-6.5-linux-x64-v2/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
sudo cp cudnn-6.5-linux-x64-v2/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
```

##### Configure TensorFlow's canonical view of Cuda libraries <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-configure-tensorflow-s-canonical-view-of-cuda-libraries"></a>
From the root of your source tree, run:

``` bash
$ ./configure
Do you wish to bulid TensorFlow with GPU support? [y/n] y
GPU support will be enabled for TensorFlow

Please specify the location where CUDA 7.0 toolkit is installed. Refer to
README.md for more details. [default is: /usr/local/cuda]: /usr/local/cuda

Please specify the location where CUDNN 6.5 V2 library is installed. Refer to
README.md for more details. [default is: /usr/local/cuda]: /usr/local/cuda

Setting up Cuda include
Setting up Cuda lib64
Setting up Cuda bin
Setting up Cuda nvvm
Configuration finished
```

This creates a canonical set of symbolic links to the Cuda libraries on your system.
Every time you change the Cuda library paths you need to run this step again before
you invoke the bazel build command.

##### Build your target with GPU support. <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-build-your-target-with-gpu-support."></a>
From the root of your source tree, run:

```bash
$ bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer

$ bazel-bin/tensorflow/cc/tutorials_example_trainer --use_gpu
# Lots of output. This tutorial iteratively calculates the major eigenvalue of
# a 2x2 matrix, on GPU. The last few lines look like this.
000009/000005 lambda = 2.000000 x = [0.894427 -0.447214] y = [1.788854 -0.894427]
000006/000001 lambda = 2.000000 x = [0.894427 -0.447214] y = [1.788854 -0.894427]
000009/000009 lambda = 2.000000 x = [0.894427 -0.447214] y = [1.788854 -0.894427]
```

Note that "--config=cuda" is needed to enable the GPU support.

##### Known issues <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-known-issues"></a>

* Although it is possible to build both Cuda and non-Cuda configs under the same
source tree, we recommend to run "bazel clean" when switching between these two
configs in the same source tree.

* You have to run configure before running bazel build. Otherwise, the build
will fail with a clear error message. In the future, we might consider making
this more conveninent by including the configure step in our build process,
given necessary bazel new feature support.

### Installation for Mac OS X <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-installation-for-mac-os-x"></a>

Mac needs the same set of dependencies as Linux, however their installing those
dependencies is different. Here is a set of useful links to help with installing
the dependencies on Mac OS X :

#### Bazel <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-bazel"></a>

Look for installation instructions for Mac OS X on
[this](http://bazel.io/docs/install.html) page.

#### SWIG <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-swig"></a>

[Mac OS X installation](http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/Preface.html#Preface_osx_installation).

Notes : You need to install
[PCRE](ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/) and *NOT* PCRE2.

#### Numpy <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-numpy"></a>

Follow installation instructions [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html).


### Create the pip package and install <a class="md-anchor" id="create-pip"></a>

```bash
$ bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

$ bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg

# The name of the .whl file will depend on your platform.
$ pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-0.5.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
```

## Train your first TensorFlow neural net model <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-train-your-first-tensorflow-neural-net-model"></a>

From the root of your source tree, run:

```python
$ python tensorflow/models/image/mnist/convolutional.py

## VirtualEnv-based installation <a class="md-anchor" id="virtualenv_install"></a>

We recommend using [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) to
create an isolated container and install TensorFlow in that container -- it is
optional but makes verifying installation issues easier.

First, install all required tools:

```bash
# On Linux:
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-virtualenv

# On Mac:
$ sudo easy_install pip  # If pip is not already installed
$ sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv
```

Next, set up a new virtualenv environment.  To set it up in the
directory `~/tensorflow`, run:

```bash
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/tensorflow
$ cd ~/tensorflow
```

Then activate the virtualenv:

```bash
$ source bin/activate  # If using bash
$ source bin/activate.csh  # If using csh
(tensorflow)$  # Your prompt should change
```

Inside the virtualenv, install TensorFlow:

```bash
(tensorflow)$ pip install --upgrade <$url_to_binary.whl>
```

You can then run your TensorFlow program like:

```bash
(tensorflow)$ python tensorflow/models/image/mnist/convolutional.py

# When you are done using TensorFlow:
(tensorflow)$ deactivate  # Deactivate the virtualenv

$  # Your prompt should change back
```


## Common Problems <a class="md-anchor" id="common_install_problems"></a>

### GPU-related issues <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-gpu-related-issues"></a>

If you encounter the following when trying to run a TensorFlow program:

```python
ImportError: libcudart.so.7.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Make sure you followed the the GPU installation [instructions](#install_cuda).

### On Linux <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-on-linux"></a>

If you encounter:

```python
...
 "__add__", "__radd__",
             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Solution: make sure you are using Python 2.7.

### On MacOSX <a class="md-anchor" id="AUTOGENERATED-on-macosx"></a>


If you encounter:

```python
    import six.moves.copyreg as copyreg

ImportError: No module named copyreg
```

Solution: TensorFlow depends on protobuf which require six-1.10.0. The
installation on some machines may only have an earlier version of six that was
installed using distutils.  Unfortunately, upgrading a distutils installed
project via `pip` is deprecated and may fail.  If you having difficulty
upgrading six, we recommend playing around with tensorflow using virtualenv.
