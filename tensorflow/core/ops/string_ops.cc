Converts each string in the input Tensor to its hash mod by a number of buckets.

The hash function is deterministic on the content of the string within the
process.

Note that the hash function may change from time to time.

num_buckets: The number of buckets.
output: A Tensor of the same shape as the input string_tensor.
