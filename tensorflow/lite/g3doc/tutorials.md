# TensorFlow Lite Tutorials and Example Applications

Here are some example applications and tutorials which demonstrate how to use
TensorFlow Lite.

## Get started

If you're just getting started, **Tensorflow for Poets 2** is a codelab that walks
you through the process of building a simple camera app that runs a TensorFlow
Lite image classification model to identify flowers.

The codelab is available for Android or iOS.

<a class="button button-primary" href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2-ios/">iOS</a>

## Mobile application samples

Here you can find examples of using TFLite on mobile devices to perform
canonical tasks like image classification, object detection, gesture
classification, and speech recognition. Both Android and iOS examples are
provided.

## TensorFlow Lite with Cloud TPUs

This tutorial walks you through training a quantized pet breed detector on
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/">Cloud TPUs</a> using transfer learning.
This involves training a object detection model on Cloud TPUs, model
quantization, and the addition of new models including RetinaNet and a MobileNet
adaptation of RetinaNet.
